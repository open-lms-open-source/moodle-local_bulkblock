# Bulk block creator

When viewing a category, a link is added to the settings menu, Bulk block creator.

Following this link presents the user with a selector to choose a block to add to ALL courses within that category (and sub-categories).

Restrictions:
* User must have the local/bulkblock:use capability at the category level they're working on.
* Blocks will only be added to the courses within the category that they have the block/BLOCKNAME:addinstance cap on (where BLOCKNAME is the block they're trying to add).
* The block will only be added to a course if it doesn't already have an instance of that block.
